# TravelWebsite
Our Project for CST. Developing a website while focusing more on the front-end.

# Running the Website on LOCALHOST
First, make sure you have Python3 and Django installed. Then, run manage.py using the below command under the TravelWebsite Folder
```sh

Then, visit [127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1:8000) on your browser to run-test the website.
