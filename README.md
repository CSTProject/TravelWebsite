# TravelWebsite
Our Project for CST. Developing a website while focusing more on the front-end.

# Running the Website on LOCALHOST
First, make sure you have Python3, Django, bs4 , lxml and dryscrape(linux only) installed. Then, run manage.py using the below command under the TravelWebsite Folder
```sh
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```
Then, visit [127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1:8000) on your browser to run-test the website. 

To share the website on LAN,remember to first allow the port 8000 through firewall. If your ip addess on LAN is , for example, 192.168.0.101, then type
```sh
$ python3 manage.py runserver 192.168.0.101:8000
```
Then, visit [192.168.0.101](http://192.168.0.101:8000) on your browser on connected devices to run-test the website.
